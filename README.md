# Security Automation Lab

This repository documents my hands-on journey transitioning from a SOC Analyst role to a Security Engineer role.

## Objective
- Build security automation tools using Python and Linux
- Apply DevOps practices (Docker, CI/CD) to security workflows
- Design SOAR-like security automation projects
- Develop real-world, CV-ready security engineering projects

## Background
Hi, me name is Rishabh Saini and I currently work in a SOC environment handling real-time security incidents involving endpoint security, XDR, and incident response. This lab focuses on moving from manual investigation to automated and scalable security solutions.

## Tech Stack
- Linux (Ubuntu)
- Python
- Docker
- Git & GitHub
- Security APIs (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB)

## Roadmap
- Linux log analysis & detection engineering
- Python-based security automation
- Containerized security tools
- CI/CD security pipelines
- End-to-end security automation platform
